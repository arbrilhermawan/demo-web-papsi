	  	<h3>Leaving away</h3>
	  			<p>Have you ever thoughts about leaving away? Are you happy here? Are you get too comfortable? How much more you can bear this city? I asked that question to myself. And I can't answer it surely. But this is surabaya. The city that some of us call home. The city that we grew up.

The traffic in this city is unbearable. Even I go to campus with my own motorcycle, and I never thoughts that I'll drive my car. Cause if I going to campus by a car, it means that I must wake up more earlier than usually.

I know that i'm contributing to the traffic by driving my car or motorcycle. The solutions? I don't know, its too complicated for my brain haha. How about public transportation? No! First, it means that wherever I going, it will take me more effort to take public transportation.  Second, My parent and I pay a taxes, so I deserve better infrastructure. And the most important, I can go everywhere I want with my own vehicle.

In some way, I love it enough to tolerate, that's why I stay and still hope that things will get better, it's like a relationship with this city, you get hurt sometimes, and I think i'm still here hoping to regain what i've lost, in vain.

Overall, I think i'm just getting bored with this city's situation. I never thought about really leaving. Cause everywhere I go to another city, I always missing a lot of thing in home. So I thought surabaya was it, I knew because i've been to other city but surabaya was always on the back of my mind.

But in the future, my children deserves a good place and better environment to grow up. Good infrastructure. Good education and I will make efforts to make it happens.</p>
