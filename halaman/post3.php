	  	<h3>I'll light you up! With my innerlight.</h3>
	  			<p>Sometimes, I'd like to imagine that I was a Hero in a Movie. How romance, if I can save you from your worst condition. I'll show you how bigger I am than the real me. I know it's just my expectation. In reality? Maybe I just a little light. But isn't it better to be a little light in the deepest and darkest place. So I can be useful for you?

Then a simple question appears and I can't answer it surely. 
"When will I become an innerlight that lights you up?" 
As the sun shining on the earth and the entire universe without remuneration.

All I can do is think about myself. No matter how old I get, I know I'll never change, I disgust myself. But, once you said to me "just be the best version of you", That moment I knew How gifted I was. And I could say 'life is beautiful'

Now, I was realized 'something' so I won't push myself too hard anymore. I'll just be me whatever lies beyond this path. And when you're lonely, I'll be close to you. I'll lights you up with my innerlight. I'll make your life brighter again. So you can say 'life is beautiful'

Then, when the unanswered question appears again.
"When will I become an innerlight that lights you up?" 
I can answer it 
"at your darkest time"</p>
