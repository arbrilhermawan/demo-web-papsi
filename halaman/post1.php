	  	<h3>I meet the future of me</h3>
	  			<p>Yesterday, as usual I come home late at night. Getting ready for my late night bath. I'm sitting here like a sponge letting everything soaks. Listening to the water flows through the shower.

2015 was so 'roller-coaster' year. sometimes I just want to give up on everything, and the last place I want to be is home but every road leads home, and every exit takes somewhere I don't know and the longer I got home, the more I suffer. feels like my effort is never enough. Just stumbled around the block a thousand times.

But after all, my journey was never easy and i made it through so far.. Though bones break, and sweat sweats, and laughter slowly fades. 
And then i saw him. And he was me, only older and wise. He was me, only thinner and less bitter.
The ghost in front of me smirks. The ghost of me. The future me.

He said, "this too shall pass, i won't tell you how the story goes, but worry not, things are always hard and this time is not easy, but the lesson you'll take in the end pays all the debt of your recent sorrow and you'll step forth."

It gets bitter and cold. But if growing up is getting old, and being older is better, then i'll get better after..

Nothing changed except everything
