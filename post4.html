	  	<h3>Forget to remember and remember to forget</h3>
	  			<p>It's 23.19 pm and I can't sleep so I think it's better to writing something than doing nothing. Yap, remember to forget and forget to remember. One word to explains it: Complicated. As you know, I really hate complicated. So let me straighten this.

Did you know something weird about hope? Sometimes, when we're really want something suddenly it became very hard to achieve.  And sometimes when you've given up. It's seems so easy to got it. But when you want it again. It became hard to achieve again. Just me or everyone experienced it?

Some people try to remember their beloved moments with beloved people but the condition coerce them to forget it. And other people try to forget it their moments with beloved people but instead make them remember continually. Just my random opinion haha!

Remember to forget or forget to remember. Different problem. Same shit. It'll hurt your heart. Slow but sure. maybe It's like when the people that you love, said that they're in love with another people. Your heart will fall a part. Pieces of nothing. And when you try to forget it, you always remember it. Sometimes something as trivial even difficult to be forgotten. So keep it simple! Haha</p>
