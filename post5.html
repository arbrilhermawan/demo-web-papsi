	  	<h3>Happiness is yours</h3>
	  			<p>Happiness is simple. Happiness is easy. Happiness is depend on your thoughts. Something simple, but If you think happiness is hard and complicated, then it will.

"I can't happy without girlfriend who loves me" its your choice. you can happy in loneliness but you choose to happy if you had a girlfriend. Happiness is simple, you make it complicated.

Happiness isn't destination. If you make it as destination, the journey will not be able to be enjoyed. it will seems so imposed. Let the journey flow like the water. If it fail, you'll appreciate yourself because you was try your best.

Happiness isn't to looking for. In sadness you can be happy. When you've just lost, you'll feel like you don't have anything anymore. Ok, losing always have 2 sides. Bereave side and disappear side. If you're in disappear side, be happy because maybe your life in future more colourful. If you're in bereave side, be happy for them. Don't forget to say thank you. That you've passed with them isn't only sadness, but happiness too. Blessed because you can remember the Excitement in sadness. Don't judge yourself. Maybe this is the best way for you and the right time to improve yourself. 

Nothing that can't be cured by things called "time"</p>
